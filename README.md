# MusicManager
Old SpotifyTool, now MediaManager si a plugin and tool for BakkesMod (Rocket League) that helps you managing and showing the music playing on your computer.
This project was my way to learn C++ and DLL process. 
This project is Open-source and we are open to modifications and help !
The aim of the project is to show the song you are playing in-game on Rocket League which is a feature that for me lacked at the time, as well as easily changing or pausing by setting keybinds to whatever key you prefer on keyboard or controller.
Now the plugin uses the WinRT API and relies on the fact that everyone is ON WINDOWS, because it doesn't work on Linux or MacOS.
To use the plugin, simply download it using BakkesMod plugin manager and use the id [not uploaded yet] to easily install it, no other step is needed !
